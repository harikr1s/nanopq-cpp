# nanopq-cpp

CPP implementation of using Product Quantization (PQ - a classic vector quantization algorithm for approximating inner products and Euclidean distances) to encode a given set of vectors into quantized form using the trained parameters, originally from [nanopq](https://github.com/matsui528/nanopq). 

The nanopq python code is for training, and the ported C/C++ code loads the trained parameters and performs quantized encoding of a given set of vectors.

A test script is also included that verifies that the quantized vectors output by the C/C++ code matches the quantized vectors generated by the original Python code.
